                            <h1 style={{fontSize: '30px'}}>What Is Detox Water?</h1>
                    <p> Detox water is water that has been infused with the flavors of fresh fruits, vegetables or herbs. It's sometimes referred to as fruit-infused water or fruit-flavored water.
                            
                            You can make detox water at home in lots of different ways, using any combination of fruits, vegetables and herbs that you like.
                            
                            Because it's made by infusing flavor, rather than juicing or blending, detox water contains very few calories. That makes it a popular drink for detox regimens like the "lemon detox" or "master cleanse."
                            
                            Detox water is also often recommended in weight loss plans, especially in place of high-sugar drinks like sugary soda and fruit juice.</p>

                           <p> Detox water is made by infusing water with fruits, vegetables or herbs. You can make your own at home using a variety of flavors.
                            How to Make Detox Water
                            Making detox water at home is very simple. All you need is water and a selection of fruits, vegetables and herbs.
                            
                            Simply chop up your ingredients and add them to hot or cold water, depending on your preference. The more of an ingredient you use, the stronger the flavor will become.
                            
                            If you're making a cold drink, you can leave the detox water in the fridge for 1â€“12 hours to allow the flavors to infuse more deeply. Be sure to remove the ingredients after this time though, so they don't begin to decompose.
                            
                            If you're in a hurry, crushing or bruising your fruit and herbs before using them can help release the flavors more quickly.
                            
                            Here are some popular detox water recipe combinations:
